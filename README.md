- 👋 Hi, I’m @RawcoinDao (UK & Global)
- 👀 I’m interested in building a user firendly decentralized industry that provides everyday services with implementation of the blockchain and the smart contract.
- Security is one of the main fundamentals for freedom and happiness. Along with financial stability there is no better pair to start this life problem solving journey with!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about blockchain, smart contracts and cryptocurrency. Using Python, Java, Solidity and more platforms if needed to implement in this Vision for the people of the future.
- How to link the blockchain and everyday living together to achieve a decentralized financial freedom that is safe and secure. 
- Using data collection, if legal? or Working with, if possible? centralized web platforms that are security vetted and approved like eg; 'checkatrade', 'trust a trader', 'indeed'and so on. Can bring self-employment and the benefits of the blockchain and smart contracts together.
- Implementing these sources of data allows the development of "RawcoinDAO"s dApp. User frinedly web interface that is powered by hybrid smart contracts. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building automated code to collect data from centralized platforms. Automated NFT fundrasing and community building dApp's, games, and the RawcoLink in the RAWCOVERSE.  Creating a web3 interface for memebers to search or provide everyday services using decentralization and smart contracts.
